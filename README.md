# react-meals

# Overview
This is just a sample/demo web app as I go about learning how to use React. I'm currently going through courses on Udemy to help with learning React and Redux. This app was one of the projects in one of the courses. I copied the intructors CSS files as I wanted to spend more of my effort on the React side as that is my main focus. I made sure to try to implement each piece on my own first.

# What's the app about
The web app shows a sample menu that allows a user to add and remove any number of meal items to their cart. 
The user can then open up their cart and modify the quantity of items in the cart and view the total price of the order.

# Personal Reflection
Pretty happy with my result on this project, I really feel like I was able to apply a lot of what I learned. Somethings I would change or update:

- Create a separate component for the button.
- Separate the context, reducer, and provider into separate files
- clean up the cartReducer function and add an UPDATE_TO_CART action type
